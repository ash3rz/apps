        type represents the type of data required by the command-line option. For example a
        `Boolean` parameter generally corresponds to a single command-line flag that takes no
        arguments. A `Text` parameter, on the other hand, generally represents some sort of textual
        information. Some parameter types are not supported by all tool types, so it is helpful in
        some cases to filter parameter types either by the tool type or optionally by the tool
        (which is used to determine the tool type). If you filter by both tool type and tool ID then
        the tool type will take precedence. Including either an undefined tool type or an undefined
